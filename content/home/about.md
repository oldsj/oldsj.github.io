## About

My professional career began in 2009 when I enlisted in the US Navy as an information systems technician. I was lucky enough to be able to work on some really interesting systems with great people, picking up network engineering early on. After separating from the Navy, I became very interested in automation and software development while working on my BSc in Computer Science full time.

I'm currently working on learning systems programming and am documenting the process here on my blog: https://blog.jamesolds.me/post/systems-programming-rust-vs-c-1/
